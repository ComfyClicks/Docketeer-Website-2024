# Docketeer-Extension Main Website 2024
This is a GitHub Repo to maintain and update Docketeer main website throughout the year. We team 18 has made it super easy for future team to deploy.

In the past, the 'tradition' is to fork the previous team repo and re-deploy your team forked repo onto Vercel and it takes too much times.
